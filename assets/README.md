# Assets

Assets used for development and testing.

Collect a few JF2 samples and put them in the [jf2 directory](./jf2/README.md).

Sample files used for testing the `/media` endpoint:

- `audio` from [Sample audio files](https://file-examples.com/index.php/sample-audio-files/)
- `photo` from [Lorem Picsum](https://picsum.photos/)
- `video` from [Sample video files](https://file-examples.com/index.php/sample-video-files/)

API testing with [Bruno](https://github.com/usebruno/bruno). See the [Micropub collection](./Micropub).
